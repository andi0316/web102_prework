## Notes

I am very inclined to coding in C++, and although I do have experience with Web dev, CSS, and JS, I was initially a bit fuzzy on the concepts. I  had to refer to documentations to re-familiarize myself with the functions and syntax. It took a some trial-and-error and debugging to get everything down.
